//list of ideas, because i get very ambitious and who knows if i'll ever figure out the majority of this list
//1. inability to throw spears, trades off for increased maul damage and the ability to lunge at enemies to deal damage
//2. face that splits apart (think like some sort of worm from science fiction)
//3. some sort of scream ability that frightens hostile creatures
//4. on death, become some sort of hunter longlegs type creature (friendly to you, but its very weak)
//5. face split thing triggers while eating and doing the lunge attack thing
//6. figure out how to make moon afraid of the player, and have 5 Pebs tell it to "kill yourself, NOW!"
//7. make coalesepedes (spiders), wormgrass, and mother spiders not attack the player
//8. give some sort of reward for killing raindeer
//9. night vision (kind of like the drone masters control grid/overseer's outline) while in dark areas 
//10. kill 5 pebs because the rot isnt doing it fast enough hehehe
//11. steal the friend's crawl speed mechanic 
//12. eventually balance stats
//13. timeline planned: between rivulet and saint
//14. get actual art
//15. add sound effects
//16. learn how to code C# 
//17. give it a desert eagle xix (in game files only)
//18. actually make the menu, sleep, ascended portraits work
//19. commit grave crimes against the scavenger population
